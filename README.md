# Music-Genre-Classification
we make use of the GTZAN
dataset, and digital signal processing techniques like mel
spectrograms to extract features of different kinds of music and
then classify this music by making use of machine learning and
deep learning methods like convolutional neural networks
(CNNs). We shall also determine the accuracy measures to
evaluate the performance of the CNN.
